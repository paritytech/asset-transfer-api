## Zombienet Testing

Zombienet is used to launch a complete network including a relay chain, and two parachains. It will create hrmp channels betweens the launched parachains allowing the testing enviornment to send xcm messages and transfer assets. 

### **Requirements**:

**Zombienet Binary**: You can download the appropriate binary from the zombienet repositor [here](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases). Ensure that it is in the root of this directory. Note: For macos users if permission is denied to run the binary you can `chmod 755 <file_name>` to allow permissions.

**Test Network Binaries**: You will need the following binaries:

- polkadot: You can find the the releases [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases).
- trappist-collator: This binary is compiled along with polkadot above. You can find it [here](https://github.com/paritytech/trappist).
- polkadot-parachain (ie: cumulus): You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases).

NOTE: When it comes to picking a version for both `cumulus` and and `polkadot` ensure they are the same. Cumulus will have an extra 0 at the end though. Ex: v0.9.37 (polkadot) -> v0.9.370 (cumulus)

Copy each binary that is necessary into the root `<root>/bin` folder.

### Running Zombienet

From the root directory run `./<zombienet_binary_name> -p native spawn zombienet.toml | tee zombienet.log`

### Create an asset

From the root directory run `yarn start:zombienet-post-script`. You can run this right after running your zombienet network.
